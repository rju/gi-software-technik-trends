# Note

The LaTeX-Template moved to https://codeberg.org/prefec2/gi-software-technik-trends

# Usage Instructions

This template was originally intended to support authors to create
papers for the Symposium on Software Performance (SSP) 2016.

## Contents

- gistt.cls document class for STT papers
- stt-template.tex the template file for your STT publication

## Usage

- Make a copy of the ssp-template.tex, e.g., ssp-2016-john.tex
- Add your content to your copy.

## Bibliography

The template and style use biblatex (3.4) configured to use the biber
backend. In case you do not have biber or want to use bibtex, you can
change to old style bibtex. You can either use the bibtex backend of
biblatex or entirly switch to bibtex. Please note you have to replace
the \printbibliography with the appropriate bibtex commands.

## Configuration

The style supports three parameters for the document-class
- bibtex: if specified as optional parameter, the style will use bibtex ```\documentclass[bibtex]{gistt}```
- backend: This option supports either bibtex for the bibtex backend of biblatex or biber (the default) ```\documentclass[backend=biber]{gistt}```
- sorting: The default sorting is year,name,title. However, if you want to overwrite this setting you can use any sort order of biblatex. ```\documentclass[sorting=none]{gistt}```
